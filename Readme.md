# CareXchange
## Overview

This project is a healthcare resource donation platform built with React.js for the front end and Node.js with MongoDB using the Mongoose module for the back end. It connects donors with available free medicines and medical facilities to recipients in need, facilitating efficient resource allocation during critical healthcare situations.

## Features

- **User Registration and Authentication**: Users can register and log in using their email or social media accounts. Authentication is implemented for data security.

- **User Profiles**: Users can create profiles with personal information, including contact details and medical conditions.

- **Medicine and Facility Listings**: The platform maintains a database of available free medicines and medical facilities, including details like name, description, quantity, expiry date, location, and contact information.

- **Donation Posting**: Registered users can post new listings for free medicines or medical facilities they want to donate. They can also upload images and specify donation conditions.

- **Donation Requests**: Users in need can request specific medicines or medical facilities. The platform provides a request system where users can provide their details and reasons for the request.

- **Notifications**: The platform sends email or push notifications to users when a new listing matching their needs is posted. It also notifies donors when a recipient requests their donation.

- **Verification and Trust**: There's a verification system for users, especially donors, to enhance trust and credibility. Users are encouraged to leave reviews and ratings for completed transactions.

- **Messaging System**: A messaging feature enables communication between donors and recipients to arrange for donation pickup or delivery.

- **Geolocation Services**: Geolocation helps users find nearby available donations and medical facilities.

- **Reporting and Moderation**: Users can report inappropriate listings or behavior. A moderation system reviews and takes appropriate actions against reported content.

- **Privacy and Security**: Data privacy and security are ensured through encryption and security best practices.
